# visualisation-tools
Our website will also offer some visualisation tools: These will include:

- a visualisation of geographic distribution: selecting, for example, a specific printer this tool can then show where the printerâ€™s books were held and how far they were disseminated; it will also allow to select one specific edition and then display where all the individual copies have been recorded geographically 

- a reconstruction of a library tool: by selecting a specific previous owner, all his/her books will be brought up, allowing the re-construction of a now dispersed library; Visually placing the books next to each other will create a sense of a library now lost
